  <p>Music is a form of art; an expression of emotions through harmonic frequencies..
     Most music includes people singing with their voices or playing musical instruments,
    such as the piano, guitar, drums or violin.<br>
    <b> “Music is to the soul what words are to the mind.”</b> </p>
    <br><br>
